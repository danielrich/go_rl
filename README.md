# go_rl
My personal exploration using RL and go. Kinda inspired by alphago and the leela zero project as well.

I want to start and work on 9x9 go and get then use that to bootstrap(perhap network and knowledge) to a high-level on 19x19. Essentially I am hoping I can leverage the weights created by the 9x9 network in order to use that on the 19x19 network. 

The long term goal of this is to create an agent that can instruct a user as good as an expert human can. The upshot of that is that I have no qualms about making sure that there is no human games/knowledge put into the game. 

plan. Build a basic python agent that can generate gtp games. At first I want to build it using a simple simple DNN with multiple heads.
